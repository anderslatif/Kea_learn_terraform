# Deploying a Key Vault

1. Create `main.tf` and paste the code example from here into it:

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/key_vault

2. Give the Key Vault a globally unique name.

Replace this with a different name:

```hcl
name                        = "examplekeyvault"
```

3. [Optional] See the `key_permissions`, `secret_permissions` and `storage_permissions`. 

For a fully fledged system they can be defined as:

```hcl
access_policy {
tenant_id = data.azurerm_client_config.current.tenant_id
object_id = data.azurerm_client_config.current.object_id

key_permissions = [
    "Get"
]

secret_permissions = [
    "Get", "List", "Delete", "Set"
]

storage_permissions = [
    "Get", "List", "Delete", "Set"
]
}
```

4. Run `terraform apply` and check in the portal. 

It should have created the Key Vault.
