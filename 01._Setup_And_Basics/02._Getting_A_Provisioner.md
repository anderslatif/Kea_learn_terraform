## Getting a provisioner

### What is a provisioner?

### Where to find the correct provisioner

The [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) is a place to find Terraform-related providers, modules and libraries. 


### Finding the Azure provisioner

`azurerm` stands for Azure Resource Manager.

It can be found below or by searching for `Terraform Azure Provider`:

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs

It provides a [basic example](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#example-usage).

## 1. Check out the content of "Example Usage" into main.tf

We will lean against it since it aimts to be the most basic use of the provider.

But it aims higher than we are going to in this project, which is to create a virtual machine. 

What we want is to understand the code, so let's break it into sizeable bites. 

## 2. In the `Example Usage`, consider which parts:

* We would want to change

* We can change for a different outcome

  <summary>I'm including the snippet just in case. It's far better that you copy it from the documentation to get the code with the latest version number</summary>

```hcl
# We strongly recommend using the required_providers block to set the
# Azure Provider source and version being used
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=3.0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Microsoft Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Create a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

# Create a virtual network within the resource group
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-network"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}
```
