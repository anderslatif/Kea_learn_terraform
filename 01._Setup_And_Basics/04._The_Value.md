## Getting a provisioner

### What is a provisioner?

### Where to find the correct provisioner

The [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) is a place to find Terraform-related providers, modules and libraries. 


### Finding the Azure provisioner

`azurerm` stands for Azure Resource Manager.

It can be found below or by searching for `Terraform Azure Provider`:

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs

It provides a [basic example](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#example-usage).

## 1. Check out the content of "Example Usage" into main.tf

We will lean against it since it aimts to be the most basic use of the provider.

But it aims higher than we are going to in this project, which is to create a virtual machine. 

What we want is to understand the code, so let's break it into sizeable bites. 

## 2. In the `Example Usage`, consider which parts:

* We would want to change

* We can change for a different outcome


<details> 
  <summary>I'm including the snippet just in case. It's far better that you copy it from the documentation to get the code with the latest version number</summary>

```hcl
# We strongly recommend using the required_providers block to set the
# Azure Provider source and version being used
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=3.0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Microsoft Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Create a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

# Create a virtual network within the resource group
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-network"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}
```
</details>


## 3. Let's start by specifying our provider to be azurerm. 

In `main.tf` (which should still be empty) add the following:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=3.0.0"
       }
  }
}

## 4. Try to format the code with . The following command will format your Terraform files to ensure that they follow Terraform's canonical format and style

```bash
$ terraform fmt
```

Did you have the file open and did you notice the result? If not try again by copying the snippet into the file and rerun the command.


<details> 
  <summary>What is supposed to happen?</summary>
   
    I intentionally mis-indented a closing curly brace. When running the command you should notice that the code is formated to fix the indentation.
</details>

Note: Formatting does not validate the correctness or internal consistency of the config. 

## 5. Let's add a resource group. 

Find the snippet that relates to resource group and paste it into `main.tf`. 

But change `West Europe` to `North Europe` since it is closer in proximity. 

Advice: Do note that there are [discrepensies in availability of services in Azure depending on region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies). 

Personal anecdote: The most hair-pulling time sinks in relation to Azure have been when trying to create a service in a region that doesn't support it, but they will not inform you that this is the problem. Always try another region if nothing else works. It might fix the problem. 

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary>
   
   Add this to `main.tf`:
  ```terraform
  resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
    name     = "example-resources"
    location = "`North Europe"
  }
  ```
</details>

## 6. Let's try to create the resource group - pre step

You should've already ran `terraform init` but in case you haven't, rerun it. 

## 7. Why `terraform validate`?

This step is [optional] when working with Terraform but still useful because `terraform validate`:

* ensures that all required arguments have been defined

* validates the internal consistency of the entire confiuration setup

However, it does not validate against the state, in fact, validate can be run against any uninitialized project. 


## 8. [Optional] Let's the validate comman:

```bash
$ terraform validate
```


The expected result is:

```bash
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

Let's apply (which will create the resource group):

```bash
$ terraform apply
```

## 9. Error handling

Uh oh. Running `terraform apply` should result in the following error:

```
│ Error: Invalid provider configuration
│ 
│ Provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm" requires explicit configuration. Add a provider block to the root module and configure the provider's
│ required arguments as described in the provider documentation.
│ 
╵
╷
│ Error: Insufficient features blocks
│ 
│   on <empty> line 0:
│   (source code not available)
│ 
│ At least 1 "features" blocks are required.
```

I should create the block that conains the `azurerm` provider config:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
}
```

## 10. Plan ahead.

Let's try again but let's take it back a step. Let's not jump straight to apply. 

We can run:

```bash
$ terraform plan
```
Uh oh, it fails as well. But this time the error is different:

```
╷
│ Error: Insufficient features blocks
│ 
│   on main.tf line 15, in provider "azurerm":
│   15: provider "azurerm" {
│ 
│ At least 1 "features" blocks are required.
╵
```

## 11. Spot the error. Can you fix it?

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary>
   
   Add an empty features block to the provider config block.

   The entire provider config block for reference:

  ```terraform
    provider "azurerm" {
      features {}
    }
  ```
</details>

#### Step back: Why are we doing all this?

This section is to motivate why we are commiting mistakes on purpose. The above case is actually based on a real issue I had to solve. 

I ran into the above problem (missing features block) by following online videos of a decently recenct video tutorial and I couldn't understand why their code didn't work for me. 

It appears that the feautures block was introduced only after version`2.0` of `azurerm` and that it wasn't required previously. 

My goal is always to help you build an understanding of the code and also a way to approach debugging in Terraform which is notoriously difficult.
